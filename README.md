# CustomCalculatorToolbox
An app that incorporates a basic calculator and notepad together in one application. Programed in Python using tkiner for the graphics and pygame for the sound. The app is a basic calculator with a notepad panel that pops out to the left side of the calculator with sound and animation when the eject button ('<<') is pressed.

This project was just a learning experience created by my own curriosity to see if animation and sound could be incorporated into a desktop application, which is something that is almost never done in any modern graphical user interfaces but something I find interesting an appealing.
I may return to this project at a later date to add an additional app or extended functionality and to improve or build upon the existing app for more experience.

Save the main.py and Click.mp3 files in the save project directory and run main.py in your IDE.
Tkinter and Pygame or the only two dependencies you will need to run this program which you can install from the terminal using the following commands
pip tkinter
pip pygame
